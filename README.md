# sdxl-colab `v1`

Lets you generate images with whatever stable diffusion model or checkpoint you want to use.

Depending on what you choose it needs to be properly configured.

Current itteration is configured for text2img using the [stable diffusion xl](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_xl) checkpoint [animagine xl 3.1](https://huggingface.co/cagliostrolab/animagine-xl-3.1).

For more info on how to prompt with this checkpoint please check out their hugging face repo.
